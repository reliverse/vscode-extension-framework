# E2E Testing

## Playwright

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is the only good option for writing Chrome Extension end-to-end tests.

To add E2E tests to your project, follow Playwright's [Chrome Extension docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/chrome-extensions). When you have to pass the path to your extension, pass the output directory, `/path/to/project/.output/chrome-mv3`.

For a complete example, see the [WXT's Playwright Example](https://github.com/wxt-dev/examples/tree/main/examples/playwright-e2e-testing).
