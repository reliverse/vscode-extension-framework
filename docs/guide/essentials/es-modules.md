# ES Modules

Currently, ESM entrypoints are opt-in, so you must configure each entrypoint with that in mind.

## HTML Pages <Badge type="warning" text="≥0.0.1" />

In general, you should always make HTML pages import ESM scripts, unless you need to support old browsers.

To make a script ESM, add `type="module"`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<script src="./main.ts"></script> <!-- [!code --] -->
<script src="./main.ts" type="module"></script> <!-- [!code ++] -->
```

## Background <Badge type="warning" text="≥0.16.0" />

In your background script, set `type: "module"`:

```ts
export default defineBackground({
  type: 'module', // !code ++
  main() {
    // ...
  },
});
```

:::warning
Only MV3 supports ESM background scripts/service workers. When targeting MV2, the `type` option is ignored and the background is always bundled into a single file as IIFE.

## Content Scripts

WXT does not yet include built-in support for ESM content scripts. The plan is to add support for chunking to reduce bundle size, but not support HMR for now. There are several technical issues that make implementing a generic solution for HMR impossible. See [Content Script ESM Support #357](https://github.com/wxt-dev/wxt/issues/357) for details.

If you can't wait, and need ESM support right now, you can implement ESM support manually. See the [ESM Content Script UI](https://github.com/wxt-dev/examples/tree/main/examples/esm-content-script-ui) example to get started.
